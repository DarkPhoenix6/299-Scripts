# gamin:     requires Gamin (a file alteration monitor) to be installed.
#            If Gamin is not installed, Fail2ban will use auto.
# polling:   uses a polling algorithm which does not require external libraries.

#         severity dynamic;

#   Since UDP is connection-less protocol, spoofing of IP and imitation
